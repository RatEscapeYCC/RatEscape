# README - Managing the Rat Escape Project Markdown File

This document explains how to manage and edit the Rat Escape project `.md` file. It also provides an overview of Markdown syntax and how to use it for creating structured content.

## Overview of Rat Escape Markdown File

The `.md` file for the Rat Escape project contains essential information about the project, including:

- About the project and token
- Key details like official website, token address, and social media links
- Explanation of the $RAT token
- Roadmap and milestones
- Where and how to buy $RAT tokens
- Instructions on how to earn TCC (Tunnel Cheese Crackers) rewards

The content is structured using Markdown syntax, which is designed to format plain text in a readable and structured way.

## Understanding Markdown Syntax

### 1. Headings (`#`)
Headings are used to create sections and subsections in the file. Markdown uses the `#` symbol to define headings:

- `#` for the main heading (e.g., `# About Rat Escape`)
- `##` for subsections (e.g., `## About $RAT`)
- `###` for further nested sections (e.g., `### Why $RAT?`)

Each level of heading is indicated by an additional `#`.

### 2. Links (`[]()`)
Markdown allows you to insert hyperlinks. You can link to websites or social media profiles using the following format:

```markdown
