# README - Managing and Editing the About.md File

This document provides guidelines on how to properly edit the **about.md** file for the Rat Escape project. The **about.md** file contains important project details that will be used as input to a Large Language Model (LLM) to generate responses for the AI agent. It is crucial to preserve the correct syntax to ensure the AI can process the information accurately.

## Why is Syntax Important?

The **about.md** file is structured in Markdown format and contains specific information that needs to be interpreted correctly by the LLM. If the formatting or syntax is incorrect, the AI might fail to generate accurate responses, leading to errors or misinterpretations.

To avoid this, follow these guidelines to maintain consistency and clarity in the document's structure.

## Key Sections in the about.md File

The **about.md** file includes the following main sections:

1. **Project Overview**: General information about the Rat Escape project, including the purpose of the project and the $RAT token.
2. **$RAT Token Details**: Information about the $RAT token, including contract addresses and other key identifiers.
3. **Why $RAT?**: Explanation of why the $RAT token is valuable, including community-driven elements and resilience.
4. **Roadmap**: The projectâ€™s timeline, including key milestones and future goals.
5. **Where to Buy $RAT**: Instructions on where users can buy $RAT tokens.
6. **TCC Rewards**: Explanation of how to earn TCC (Tunnel Cheese Crackers) and how rewards are calculated.

## Guidelines for Editing the about.md File

### 1. **Headings and Subheadings**

- Use `#` for main headings (e.g., `# About Rat Escape`)
- Use `##` for subsections (e.g., `## About $RAT`)
- Use `###` for further nested sections (e.g., `### Why $RAT?`)

### 2. **Maintaining Links**

Ensure all links are correctly formatted using `[Link Text](URL)` syntax. Do not modify the URLs unless necessary. Links in the **about.md** file are often provided to social media platforms, exchange websites, and official resources.

### 3. **Lists**

Ensure that lists are formatted correctly:
- Use `-` or `*` for unordered lists.
- Use `1.`, `2.`, etc., for ordered lists.

### 4. **Numbered Lists**

To create a numbered list, simply number the items:

1. First item
2. Second item

### 5. **Bold and Italic Text**

Text that requires emphasis should be marked with the appropriate syntax:
- **Bold text**: Use `**` to mark bold text (e.g., `**Bold Text**`).
- *Italic text*: Use `*` or `_` to mark italic text (e.g., `*Italic Text*`).

### 6. **Code Blocks and Inline Code**

For specific terms or tokens like `$RAT`, use inline code syntax by surrounding the text with single backticks (```).

For longer code blocks or multi-line code, use triple backticks (```).

### 7. **TCC Reward Section**

Make sure the TCC reward calculation is accurate and the formatting is consistent with how it was previously. This section will be used by the AI to explain reward mechanics, so accuracy is vital.

The reward formula should be clearly defined:
The reward is 0.5% of the $RAT tokens held, with a daily cap of 1,000 TCC.

### 8. **Preserve the Structure and Formatting**

It's essential to maintain the structure of the document as closely as possible. For example:
- The order of sections must not be changed.
- All headings, lists, and subheadings must be properly formatted.

Do **not** change the section names or reorder them. The LLM will rely on the specific structure to generate responses correctly.

## Tips for Editing the about.md File

- **Be Consistent**: Ensure that formatting is consistent throughout the file, especially for key details like token addresses, URLs, and milestones.
- **Check for Typos**: Since the document will feed into an AI model, ensure that all text is free of typos and errors.
- **Avoid Complex Formatting**: Keep the formatting simple and clear. The more straightforward the structure, the easier it will be for the LLM to process the content.
- **Double-Check Links**: Ensure that all links are valid and lead to the correct resources.

## Conclusion

Maintaining the integrity of the **about.md** file is critical for the accurate operation of the AI agent that will use this file as input. By following the provided guidelines, you ensure that the AI can interpret the project details correctly and generate relevant responses.

For any further questions or assistance in editing the **about.md** file, please reach out to the project maintainers or consult the Markdown documentation.

Happy editing!
