- Use `#` for main headings (e.g., `# About Rat Escape`)
- Use `##` for subsections (e.g., `## About $RAT`)
- Use `###` for further nested sections (e.g., `### Why $RAT?`)

### 2. **Maintaining Links**

Ensure all links are correctly formatted using `[Link Text](URL)` syntax. Do not modify the URLs unless necessary. Links in the **about.md** file are often provided to social media platforms, exchange websites, and official resources.

### 3. **Bold and Italic Text**

Text that requires emphasis should be marked with the appropriate syntax:
- **Bold text**: Use `**` to mark bold text (e.g., `**Bold Text**`).
- *Italic text*: Use `*` or `_` to mark italic text (e.g., `*Italic Text*`).

### 4. **Lists**

Ensure that lists are formatted correctly:
- Use `-` or `*` for unordered lists.
- Use `1.`, `2.`, etc., for ordered lists.

### 5. **Numbered Lists**

To create a numbered list, simply number the items:

1. First item
2. Second item

### 6. **Preserve the Structure and Formatting**

It's essential to maintain the structure of the document as closely as possible. For example:
- The order of sections must not be changed.
- All headings, lists, and subheadings must be properly formatted.

Do **not** change the section names or reorder them. The LLM will rely on the specific structure to generate responses correctly.

## Tips for Editing the about.md File

- **Be Consistent**: Ensure that formatting is consistent throughout the file, especially for key details like token addresses, URLs, and milestones.
- **Check for Typos**: Since the document will feed into an AI model, ensure that all text is free of typos and errors.
- **Avoid Complex Formatting**: Keep the formatting simple and clear. The more straightforward the structure, the easier it will be for the LLM to process the content.
- **Double-Check Links**: Ensure that all links are valid and lead to the correct resources.
